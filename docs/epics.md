## Overview

This document defines the implementation epics for Personal TaskBoard, breaking down the solution architecture into discrete deliverable phases. Each epic is scoped to be independently implementable while contributing to the overall MVP.

**Epic Dependency Chain:**
```
Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 3 → Epic 4 → Epic 5 → Epic 6 → Epic 7
```

## Epic Priority and Sequencing

### Implementation Order (Sequential)

1. **Epic 1: Foundation Setup** (0.5 days)
   *Critical path - all other epics depend on this*

2. **Epic 2: Task Display and Organization** (1.5 days)
   *Establishes core UI and data flow*

3. **Epic 3: Task Creation** (1 day)
   *First major user-facing feature*

4. **Epic 4: Task Management** (2 days)
   *Completes core CRUD functionality*

5. **Epic 5: Progress Tracking** (0.5 days)
   *Adds motivational feature*

6. **Epic 6: Polish and Accessibility** (1.5 days)
   *Ensures professional quality and compliance*

7. **Epic 7: Testing and Quality Assurance** (2 days)
   *Validates all work and ensures stability*

**Total Estimated Effort:** 9 days (1.8 weeks for single developer)

### Parallel Work Opportunities

While the epics are primarily sequential, some parallel work is possible:

- **Epic 6 (Polish)** can begin incrementally during Epic 4-5 (add animations as features complete)
- **Epic 7 (Testing)** - Unit and component tests can start during Epic 3-6 using TDD approach:
  - Epic 3: Write unit tests for database queries and TaskForm component
  - Epic 4: Write unit tests for mutation functions and TaskCard/TaskColumn components
  - Epic 5: Write unit tests for completion count calculations
  - Epic 6: Write accessibility tests as features are polished
  - Epic 7: Complete comprehensive E2E test suite and achieve coverage targets
- Component tests can be written alongside component implementation throughout Epic 3-6

---

## Cross-Epic Concerns

### Shared Components and Patterns

**TaskForm Component:**
- Created in Epic 3 (create mode)
- Enhanced in Epic 4 (edit mode)
- Tested in Epic 7

**Modal Dialog Pattern:**
- Established in Epic 3 (task creation)
- Reused in Epic 4 (task editing, delete confirmation)
- Accessibility enhanced in Epic 6

**Server Actions Pattern:**
- First implemented in Epic 3 (`createTaskAction`)
- Extended in Epic 4 (`updateTaskAction`, `updateTaskStatusAction`, `deleteTaskAction`)
- All follow same validation and error handling pattern

**Database Query Pattern:**
- Established in Epic 2 (read operations)
- Extended in Epic 3-4 (write operations)
- All use Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries

### Design System Consistency

All epics must adhere to:
- Tailwind CSS utility classes (no custom CSS without justification)
- shadcn/ui component primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Textarea, Dropdown)
- Illustrate Inc. brand colors (defined in `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Consistent spacing scale (4px/8px/12px/16px/24px/32px)
- Typography hierarchy (heading levels, font sizes)
