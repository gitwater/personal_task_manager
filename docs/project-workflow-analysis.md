# Project Workflow Analysis

**Project:** Personal TaskBoard
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Analysis Type:** Greenfield Project

---

## Project Classification

### Project Level: 1
**Rationale:** Simple CRUD web application with local persistence. Single developer, straightforward requirements, no complex integrations.

**Level Characteristics:**
- Simple three-column task board
- Basic CRUD operations
- Local-only (no auth, no multi-user)
- Single monolithic Next.js app
- Straightforward data model

### Field Type: Greenfield
**Rationale:** New application, no existing codebase

### Project Type: Web
**Rationale:** Next.js + React web application optimized for desktop browsers

### User Interface
- **has_user_interface:** true
- **ui_complexity:** simple
- **ux_spec_path:** /docs/ux-specification.md
- **ux_spec_status:** complete

### Requirements Status
- **prd_status:** complete
- **prd_path:** /docs/PRD.md

---

## Technical Characteristics

### Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Next.js
- **Backend:** Next.js (monolithic)
- **Database:** SQLite (local)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)

### Architecture Style
- **Monolithic** Next.js application
- **Monorepo** structure
- No microservices
- No external APIs

### Complexity Indicators
- ✅ Simple data model (tasks with status)
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Local persistence only
- ✅ Single-page application
- ✅ No authentication
- ✅ No external integrations
- ✅ Desktop-only (no mobile)

## Project-Specific Notes

### Scale Assessment
**Level 1** project characteristics:
- Single developer can complete in reasonable timeframe
- No specialist expertise required beyond Next.js/React
- Straightforward testing requirements
- No complex DevOps or infrastructure
- No compliance requirements

### Architecture Recommendations
- Use Next.js App Router with Server Components
- Simple server actions for mutations
- SQLite with lightweight ORM (Prisma or Drizzle)
- Component library (shadcn/ui recommended for speed)
- Basic E2E testing with Playwright
