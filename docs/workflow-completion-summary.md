## Key Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Summary

| Category | Technology | Version | Reason |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js | 15.0.3 | Server Components, optimal performance |
| UI Library | React | 19.0.0 | Latest with concurrent features |
| Language | TypeScript | 5.7.2 | Strict mode, type safety |
| Database | SQLite + Drizzle | 11.5.0 + 0.36.4 | Local-only, type-safe ORM |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | 3.4.17 | Rapid dev, Illustrate brand colors |
| Components | shadcn/ui | latest | Accessible, customizable |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright | 3.1.4 + 1.49.1 | Modern, fast, reliable |

### Architecture Pattern

**Monolithic Next.js Application**
- Server Components for data fetching (reduce client JS)
- Client Components for interactivity (forms, drag-drop)
- Server Actions for mutations (type-safe, no API routes)
- SQLite for local persistence (zero-config)

### Repository Strategy

**Monorepo** - Single repository, all code in one place

### Epic Breakdown

7 epics, 9 days estimated effort:

```
Week 1: Foundation → Display → Creation → Management
Week 2: Progress → Polish → Testing → Buffer
```

## Requirements Coverage Verification

### Functional Requirements (FR1-FR10)

| FR | Requirement | Architecture Coverage |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| FR1 | Create task with title and note | TaskForm + createTaskAction ✅ |
| FR2 | View tasks in three columns | TaskBoard + TaskColumn components ✅ |
| FR3 | Move tasks between columns | updateTaskStatusAction + dropdown ✅ |
| FR4 | Edit task title and note | TaskForm (edit) + updateTaskAction ✅ |
| FR5 | Delete task | deleteTaskAction ✅ |
| FR6 | View completion summary | CompletionSummary + queries ✅ |
| FR7 | Tasks persist to database | SQLite + Drizzle ORM ✅ |
| FR8 | Tasks sorted most recent first | Database indexes + orderBy ✅ |
| FR9 | Display title, note, timestamp | TaskCard component ✅ |
| FR10 | Track created, updated, completed timestamps | Database schema (3 timestamp fields) ✅ |

**Coverage: 10/10 (100%)** ✅

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1-NFR11)

All 11 NFRs addressed in architecture:
- NFR1 (local-only): SQLite database ✅
- NFR2 (page load < 300ms): Server Components ✅
- NFR3 (TypeScript strict): tsconfig.json ✅
- NFR4 (ESLint): ESLint config ✅
- NFR5 (unit tests >70%): Vitest with coverage ✅
- NFR6 (E2E tests): Playwright, 7 test suites ✅
- NFR7-11 (architecture): Component hierarchy, responsive, reusable ✅

**Coverage: 11/11 (100%)** ✅

### User Stories (US1-US7)

All 7 user stories have complete implementation paths:
- US1 (Quick Task Capture): TaskForm + Server Action ✅
- US2 (Visual Workflow): TaskBoard layout ✅
- US3 (Task Progression): Status dropdown ✅
- US4 (Task Detail Management): Edit form ✅
- US5 (Task Removal): Delete action ✅
- US6 (Progress Visibility): CompletionSummary ✅

   ```

5. Set up database:
   ```bash
   npm install drizzle-orm better-sqlite3
   npm install -D drizzle-kit @types/better-sqlite3
   mkdir data
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
